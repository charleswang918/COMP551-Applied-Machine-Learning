# Applied Machine Learning Group Projects
## Contents
The contents of this repository consists of 4 group mini-projects are given by [Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/) for COMP 551 Applied Machine Learning course during Winter 2022 at McGill University. The course website is: http://www.reirab.com/Teaching/AML22/index.html

## Project 1-Getting Started with Machine Learning 
Implement K-Nearest Neighbour and Decision Trees from scratch; Train both two classification models on Hepatitis dataset and Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen dataset; Compare two algorithms on two distinct health dataset.
## Project 2-Classification of Textual Data
Implement Naive Bayes and K-fold cross-validation from scratch; Traing both two classification models on 20 news group dataset and Sentiment140 dataset; Use logisitc regression from scikit-learn package and compare all algorithms on two distinct textual datasets.
## Project 3-Classification of Image Data
Implement a basic neural network(multilayer perceptron) from scratch; Train multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network on Fashion-MNIST dataset to classify image data; Run experiments on both neural network models.
## Project 4-Reproducibility in Machine Learning
Reproducibility challenge in Machine learning; Select a paper and reproduce the results of the paper by exact methods.
